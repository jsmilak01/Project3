## Notes

I was unable to get full functionality of the app, my done button on the second screen would not do anything
and I just could not figure out why it wouldnt work.
Still was unable to get the done button to work and did not realize I had passed data incorrectly between layouts until due dat and was unable to figure it out in time.
Sorry there is not much more added to the project I got a bit behind in a couple classes but I will come to office hours next week to try and figure out what I have missed.
